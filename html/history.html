        As Sikhs began to realize the oppressive regimes of the Indian
        government, this including the erasure of our mother tongue (Punjabi),
        being mislabeled and treated as second class citizens, drugs being
        poured into our homeland to suppress us, corruption amongst government
        with killings or torture of Sikhs by the hands of police in fake
        encounters… A Saintly Warrior emerged in this era named Sant Jarnail
        Singh Bhinderanwale. He fought vigorously for the rights of Sikh’s and
        started to arm the youth against this oppression. Long in the making was
        the plan of eliminating this movement and attacking the heart of the
        Sikh faith. In June 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered Operation
        Bluestar which was an army invasion of Harmandir Sahib (Sikh’s holiest
        shrine). Her goal was to kill off all innocent Sikh’s that supported the
        movement of Sikh rights and labeling them as terrorists for retaliating
        against the government’s tyranny. While this battle took place there was
        a media blackout. Punjab (the homeland of Sikhs) was cut off from the
        rest of the world, leaving the government to get away with murder and
        injustice.
